# Join a Network

Now, let's join one of the available networks running on Archway. There are different ways to do it.

- [Sync from genesis](/validators/running-a-node/sync-from-genesis): sync your node from the genesis block. When syncing from genesis, the node downloads and processes the entire blockchain history starting from the very first block (the genesis block). This method is the most comprehensive and secure, as it independently validates each block and transaction. However, it can be time-consuming, particularly for well-established blockchains with a long history.

- [Sync with state-sync](/validators/running-a-node/sync-with-state-sync): quickly sync to the current blockchain state without processing the entire history. With state-sync, the node downloads a snapshot of the current state from a trusted source and then begins validating new blocks. State-sync is faster than syncing from genesis, but it relies on trusting the source of the snapshot. This method is generally considered secure if you can trust the source, but it might be less secure than syncing from genesis.

<<<<<<< HEAD
- [Sync from snapshot](/validators/running-a-node/sync-from-snapshot): from a snapshot is similar to state-sync but involves manually downloading a snapshot of the blockchain state and importing it into the node. This method is also faster than syncing from genesis, but it comes with the same trust issues as state-sync. It is essential to verify the integrity and authenticity of the snapshot before using it.
=======
If you already tried setting up a node or running a local testnet, it may be good to remove any  previous genesis file and configuration that you have used, let's first cleanup our network.

::highlight-card

```bash
rm -rf ~/.archway
```

::

::alert{variant="warning"}
This command will remove all data and configs you already set.

<!--## Initialize the node

Now run the following command to initialize the genesis file which is required to establish a network. In this guide, we will also show example of connecting to the [Constantine Developer Testnet](https://docs.archway.io/docs/overview/network#constantine-dapp-developer-testnet).

```

<!--### **Constantine Example**

Using Docker, here is how to initialize the node for the Constantine Testnet:
::highlight-card

```bash
docker run -v ${HOME}/.archway:/root/.archway docker.io/archwaynetwork/archwayd:0.0.5  init munshi --chain-id constantine-2
```

::
ADDED TO THE 1.INSTALL SECTION-->
## Retrieve the Genesis file

First, you will need to use the [Networks page](../../resources/networks) to find information like the `<chain-id>` and `<rpc-url>` of the network you would like to connect to.

With the above data, make sure to download correct Genesis file, by fetching it from an available node:

::highlight-card

```bash
curl -s "$RPC_ENDPOINT/genesis" | jq '.result.genesis' > ~/.archway/config/genesis.json
```

::
### **Constantine Genesis file**
For example, you can launch the command to connect to the RPC Endpoint of the Constantine network, and download the Genesis File:
::highlight-card

```bash
curl -s https://rpc.constantine-2.archway.tech/genesis |jq -r .result.genesis > ${HOME}/.archway/config/genesis.json
```

## Start archwayd


Start the archway and join the network:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}
#title0
Binary

#desc0
::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd start \
  --x-crisis-skip-assert-invariants
  --p2p.seeds Address1@Host_Name_OR_IP1:PORT1, ...AddressN@Host_Name_OR_IPN:PORTN \
```
::

```bash
docker run --rm -it -v ~/.archway:/root/.archway archwaynetwork/archwayd:$NETWORK_NAME \
  start \
  --x-crisis-skip-assert-invariants
  --p2p.seeds Address1@Host_Name_OR_IP1:PORT1, ...AddressN@Host_Name_OR_IPN:PORTN \
```

Below is the command to join the **Constantine testnet**:

::tab-card{noOfTabs=2}

::highlight-card

```bash
archwayd start \
  --x-crisis-skip-assert-invariants

```

docker run -v ${HOME}/.archway:/root/.archway -p 9091:9091 -p 9090:9090 -p 26656:26656 -p 26657:26657 -p 1317:1317 docker.io/archwaynetwork/archwayd:constantine \

```

<!--Please note that currently the flag **--unsafe-skip-upgrades 187340** is needed to correctly sync your node. Alternatively, you can directly sync from that specific block, for example by adding the flag: **--halt-height 187341** instead.
-->
## Cleaning up (optional)

In case you want to remove any previous previous genesis file and configuration that you have used, you can clean up the network.

::highlight-card

```bash
rm -rf ~/.archway
```

::

::alert{variant="warning"}
This command will remove all data and configs you already set.

## Next Steps
Now that you have joined a network, you can either [start validating](../becoming-a-validator/overview), or further [configure](/configure) the validator (optional).
