# Using Websockets


**arch3js** is a wrapper of **cosmjs** which makes it easier to interact with Archway's native modules. Anyways, for specific use cases you may want to use directly **cosmjs**, as it is a comprehensive tool that is available for the Cosmos ecosystem.

In this section we will look into how to use the websocket functionality provided by cosmjs to subscribe to events from the Archway network. More specifically, we will explain how to use WebSockets with the **@cosmjs/tendermint-rpc** package to interact with the Archway network.

## Dependencies


- Install <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm" target="_blank">npm and node</a>
- Install <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cosmjs/tendermint-rpc" target="_blank">@cosmjs/tendermint-rpc</a>.


## Create a new project and install dependencies

Make sure to have <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm" target="_blank">npm and node</a> installed, then create a new node project by launching:

::highlight-cart
```bash
npm init -y
```

Install **@cosmjs/tendermint-rpc** by launching:

::highlight-card
```bash
npm install -g @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc
```
::

## Create an index.js

Within your project directory, create an **index.js** and paste the following code:

::highlight-card
```javascript
// Import the WebsocketClient class from the @cosmjs/tendermint-rpc package
const { WebsocketClient } = require('@cosmjs/tendermint-rpc');
const address = 'archway1szn4zwmmu73ktn04qswh0xgvjnnsrwmkqm8daa';

// Declare a variable to store the subscription object
let subscription;

// Declare an async function to query for balance updates
const queryForBalanceUpdate = async () => {
  try {
    // Create a new WebSocket client connected to the specified URL and with an error handler
    const websocket = new WebsocketClient('wss://rpc.constantine-2.archway.tech/', (error) =>
      console.error(error)
    );

    // Set up the JSON-RPC request to subscribe to the transaction events using the websocket client
    const stream = websocket.listen({
      jsonrpc: '2.0',
      method: 'subscribe',
      id: '0',
      params: {
        query: `tm.event = 'Tx' AND transfer.recipient CONTAINS '${address}'`,
      },
    });

    // Subscribe to the stream of transaction events
    subscription = stream.subscribe({
    // The next function is called for each transaction event
      next: (_res) => {
        console.log('Matching transaction found' + JSON.stringify(_res));
      },
      error: (err) => {
        throw err;
      },
      // The complete function is called when the subscription is completed
      complete: () => {
        websocket.disconnect();
      },
    });
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(err);
    // Declare a function to disconnect from the WebSocket and unsubscribe from the event stream
    disconnectFromWebsocket();
  }
};

const disconnectFromWebsocket = () => {
  if (subscription) {
    subscription.unsubscribe();
  }
};
// Add an event listener to clean up the WebSocket connection and unsubscribe when the process exits
process.on('exit', () => {
  disconnectFromWebsocket();
});

// Call the queryForBalanceUpdate function to start listening for transaction events
queryForBalanceUpdate();
```

The above code sets up a WebSocket client to connect to a Tendermint RPC server and subscribes to transaction events. We are using the **@cosmjs/tendermint-rpc** package to interact with the Archway network via WebSocket, and the code outputs the details of transactions as soon as they occur as a JSON.

The essential part of the script is the **queryForBalanceUpdate** function, which establishes a WebSocket connection using the WebsocketClient class from the **@cosmjs/tendermint-rpc** package. It then creates a subscription using the listen method and the specified query parameters.

The query parameters can be set to subscribe to transactions where the recipient's address, the IBC destination channel, and the fungible token denom match the specified values. In this case we are listening to all the transactions for a specific archway address **${address}**. The WebSocket connection is closed by calling the disconnect method.

Note that we are using the **wss://rpc.constantine-2.archway.tech/websocket** endpoint.
