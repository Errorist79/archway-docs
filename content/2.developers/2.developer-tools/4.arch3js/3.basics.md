# Basics

## Querying

Querying the blockchain is a way to understand the events and statuses that happen inside a smart contract. Below is an example using the increment contract template to Constantine.

::highlight-card

```js
import { ArchwayClient } from '@archwayhq/arch3.js';

const client = await ArchwayClient.connect('https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech');

const contractAddress = 'archway1dd8xfz4msg7aufxcc4sjjzusg4rsp98kza2z7zjprhgwvmpdzncq6jrg99';
const msg = {
  get_count: {},
};
const { count } = await client.queryContractSmart(contractAddress, msg);
```

## Executing a transaction

Executing a transaction includes actions such as transferring NFTs between addresses or interacting with a smart contract. In the below code example, we are sending a msg object to execute the increment function inside the smart contract.

::highlight-card

```js

import { SigningArchwayClient } from '@archwayhq/arch3.js';
import { DirectSecp256k1HdWallet } from '@cosmjs/proto-signing';

const network = {
  chainId: 'constantine-1',
  endpoint: 'https://rpc.constantine-1.archway.tech',
  prefix: 'archway',
};

const alice = {
  // This is an incomplete mnemonic used for demo purposes only. Please, never hard code your seed phrases.
  mnemonic: 'culture blossom ten thing bar ...',
  address0: 'archway1cw3vd33zxyy5jk38azn3l8ytw53dwh8h73jugf',
};

const wallet = await DirectSecp256k1HdWallet.fromMnemonic(alice.mnemonic, { prefix: network.prefix });
const client = await SigningArchwayClient.connectWithSigner(network.endpoint, wallet, {
  ...defaultSigningClientOptions,
  prefix: network.prefix,
});

const contractAddress = 'archway14v952t75xgnufzlrft52ekltt8nsu9gxqh4xz55qfm6wqslc0spqspc5lm';
const msg = {
  increment: {},
};
const { transactionHash } = await client.execute(alice.address0, contractAddress, msg, 'auto');
```
